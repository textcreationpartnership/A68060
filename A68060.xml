            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

Doctour doth glory) we enioy a flourishing Cleargy, which we could neuer haue expected had the principall care of vs been leaft vnto a Domesticall Bishops</p>
            <p n="3">3. Notwithstanding in this treatise this course of gouerment is impugned as Anarchicall, as taking away the uery essence of a particular Church; as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priuing vs of that Sacrament without which Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans cannot be perfect in that very time when perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is specially necessary; as being a continual vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the deuine Law; as a going against the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall practise of the ancient Church, which in the greater fury of persecution neuer omitted to giue their Bishops to euery particular Church. Heerwith he mingleth mighty cōmendaciōs of Episcopal digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tye &amp; state to make the vulgar sort to be enāoured of a Bishop, and to be the readier to yeeld to his sugge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to admit of my Lord of Chalcedon as their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, their spirituall King and <hi>Prince of Pastours;</hi> wheras his Hollines will haue him receaued but as a delegate at the most, In the ordering likewise of the Ecclesiasticall Hierarchy though he pretend therin to proceed with great contradiction of <hi>Caluine;</hi> yet
<pb facs="tcp:17225:3"/> would he faine displace those sacred Rankes, which <hi>Caluin</hi> did more feare and hate then some of those M. Doctours affection would prefere.</p>
            <p n="4">4. His treatise in the inward disposition thereof &amp; very bowels tending to reprehēd the constant practi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>se of the <hi>piller of truth,</hi> hardly may we expect his doctrine should be euery way sound; yet the censure thereof I leaue to others, the <hi>iudiciall</hi> to the chaire of Peeter, the <hi>iudicious</hi> to the learned reader to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon exact discussion, which I haue endeauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to make in this my Answere. Onely this I dare affirme, that strong affectio to the reuerend Order of Secular English Priests, ioyned with ardent desire to see Bishops amongst them, hath caused his pen to runne towards that side, (I will not say from Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like like truth) but from Catholike current opinion, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than otherwise his learning deuoyd of partia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity would haue gonne. The same zeale is the cause that euery where about these matters he vseth darke and ambiguous sentences, which the vulgar reader can hardly cōceiue, but in an erroneous sense, fauou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his cause, though perchance by some subtill distinction he may contend that was not his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This also I may say (and learned men that haue perused the treatise will concurre in opinion with) me that this treatise is not to compare with his former writings for exactnes; yea he giueth his here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall aduersary (against whom he would seem to write) many aduantages to insult ouer, him, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiks for his sakes. Such be some m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17225:4"/> vpon the grasse of mountaines. And againe, in the same nūber the <hi>scripture compareth Lucifer to Behemoth adorned with mine preatious stones;</hi> where is Behemoth adorned with preatious stones found in scripture? He saith c. 9. n. 14. that at the first Bishops &amp; Priests only preached the Ghospell, and conuerted coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys; is not this great forgetfulnes? Who doth not know that <hi>S.

                  <p n="4">4. Thirdly the falshood of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours assertion is proued by his owne examples. He sayth that Catholiks of England wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout a Bishop were no church, but a flocke without a pastour, an army without a Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, a ship without a Pilote, a spirituall Kingdome without a spirituall King. Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce I thus argue, but a flocke without a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour is a true flocke, an army without a Generall, a true army, a Kingdome without a King, a true Kingdome, <hi>ergo</hi> Catholiks without a Bishop, are a true flocke, army, ship, Kingdome of Christ, and consequently a true Church: yea M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours speech, may seeme to imply, and one part to destroy the other. <hi>Catholiks were no Church</hi> (sayth he) <hi>without a Bishop, but a flocke without a Pastour,</hi> What is a flocke of Christ without a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stour, but a Church without a Bishop? How then doth this speach hang togeather? there is no Church without a Bishop, and yett there is a flocke of Christ, without a Pastour. And what is a spirituall Kingdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but a particular Church? You say in the same sentence Catholiks of England with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17225:11"/> a spirituall King, were a spirituall King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and yett without a Bishop, you say, they were no Church. Is not this to speake contradictories with the same breath? The cause of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours mistakinge, is his not calling to mind that rule of Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, that words in definition doe not signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the act, but the aptitude of a thing. If one say a man is he that doth discourse, the sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se is, by nature apt to discourse. Thus, a floc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ke may be defined to be sheepe ruled by one Pastour, that is, so disposed and vnited to geather as they may be fittly ruled by one Pastour. A shipp is that which is gouerned by a Pilote, that is, a frame of wood so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacted as it is fitt to passe through the sea vnder gouernment of a Pilote. In this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner a Church may be sayd a multitude of Christians gouerned by a Bishop, that is, a company so disposed and vnited togeather in the fayth of Christ, as they may haue, and need a Bishop, and are in mind ready, apt prepared to receaue him, when he is lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly sent.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Fourthly, hence I proue the falsehood of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours assertion, by shewing the true sence of <hi>S. Cyprians</hi> saying, <hi>the Church is a flocke adhering to their Pastour, a people vnited to their Bishop.</hi> For his meaning is not, that to haue a Bishop, is of the essence of the Church. So that when Catholiks simply want a Bishop, they are not a Church (so to
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17225:11"/> vnderstand <hi>S. Cyprian</hi> may seeme silly:) but that the true Church is still vnited to their Pastour, actually when they haue one, and when they haue none, yet vnited in prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of mind, and by professed ready sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection to him, as soone as they shall haue one lawfully chosen. Euen as a Kingdome ceaseth not to be a Kingdome by the death of the King, so longe as they continue in a professed resolution of mind, to haue a King and obay him, so soone as he is lawfully chosen; So likewise a Church ceaseth not to be a Church, by the death of their Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, if they continue such a multitude as they need a Bishop, with readines to recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue him, so soone as he shall be lawfully gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen them. But as a Kingdome resoluing ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer to haue King more, and not to obay the King next chosen, is no more Kingdome; so a Church banding agaynst a Bishop, and resolute not to receaue him when he is law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully giuen, ceaseth to be a Church, and are made a company of schismaticks.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Hence with <hi>S. Cyprian,</hi> not to be vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to their Bishop, is not simply to want a Bishop, but to be opposite and schisma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks against the Bishop they haue, and if they haue none, yet to be schismaticks against him in preparation of mind, as being ready to oppose and refuse the Bishop, when he shall be chosen. For which cause he tearmeth those that are not vnited to
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17225:12"/> their Bishop <hi>schismaticks, not of the Church, men not hauing peace with the Priests of God, Contumax &amp; superba obedire nolentium multitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do.</hi> A stubborne and proud multitude of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusers to obey. Will M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour say that the Catholiks of England when they wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a Bishop (because so many learned and holy Popes thought it not sitt to giue them one) were during that time schismaticks, aliens from Gods Priests, out of the Church, a proud and contumacions multitude of people? In deed by the consequence of his discourse, the black note of schisme falleth euen on the purple robes of our renowned Martyres. But I presume against his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning. Because he mistook <hi>S. Cypriās</hi> meaning. For our Catholicks euer were vnited with their Bishops, so longe as they had them, and now at vnited in preparation of mind to as many Bishops as euer were in the Real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, when times shall be such as his holines shall think fitt to restore them. I could wonder that a proposition so strang as this is, <hi>To haue a Bishop is of the definition of a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Church,</hi> was by so learned a Doctour so easily affirmed, and so slightly proued, by a text of <hi>Sainct Cyprian</hi> so mainely mistaken against the whole drift of his discourse: But I remember <hi>Bellarmines</hi> frendly censure, <hi>Mirum non est Cyprianum errantem; errantium moreratiocinari.</hi>

                  <p n="12">12. IF Catholicks were no particular Church before my Lord of Chalce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons comming, they ar not now a particular Church, nor can be made such a Church, by being vnited to him. This assertion some may ground on this, that my Lord is no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, nor hath any coactiue iurisdiction, being but a meere voluntarie delegate, or according to the phrase of the law, a <hi>char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulary</hi> iudg.

Now if my Lord be not ordinary nor Pastour, Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liks by being vnited to him, can not be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de a Church, that is, a flock cleauing to their Pastour, But vpon this argument, I will not insist, nor meddle with my Lords Delegated Ordinaryship, the same being referred to higher powers. <hi>Requicescat in pace,</hi> in the hands of the supreme iudge on earth, till he be pleased to giue sentence for, or against it.</p>

Will any man say that because that Father for order is a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop, therefore the house of Iesuites by him gouerned is a Bishopricke? surely no man that is wise will so thincke, and consequēt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, though my Lord of Chalcedon be Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop for order, he is not of dignity, not au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to make England a Bishopricke, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he be Bishop, in iurisdiction and office, which surely my Lord of Chalcedon is not in respect of England. He will be content to

                  <p n="14">14. Hence I argue, that England eyther was a particular Church before my Lords coming, or now is not, for I demaund of M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.

For that one be deputy of a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopricke, it doth not suffice that he be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puty of a Bishop, but he must be deputy of one, that is proper Bishop in respect of that place wherein he is deputy. Euen as that one be deputy in a Kingdome, it is not enough that he be deputy of a King, but he must be deputy of the proper King of that country. For example, the King of Spaine his deputy for Millan is the deputy of a King, yet is he not deputy of a Kingdome, because the King of spaine is not King, but only Duke in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect of Milan. But the same Kings deputy for Naples is deputy of a Kingdome, becau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>se he is not only deputy of a King but allso of the proper King of that place.

                  <p n="15">15. Thirdly, I proue this assertion out of that which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour often affirmes, that my Lord of Chalcedon cannot challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge any particular Bishopricke in England.<note place="margin">

Doctour say that by no particular Church, he meant no materiall church, whether Cathedrall, or Parochiall, not a liuing Church composed of Catholicke professors, for ouer these my Lord hath the iurisdiction of a Bishop, but without teritory, diocese or district. I reply this doctrine cannot subsist. Because a Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop without a diocese cannot subsist. Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neralls and Prouincialls of Regular orders, haue Episcopall iurisdiction most ample, ouer persons spread ouer the world, or some great prouince, yet are they not Bishops, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they haue no teritory, diocese, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strict.

Seing this diuine state is our diuine Natiuity, neuer shall the man know the thinges deliuered of God, Nor worke them, that hath not get attayned vnto this diuine state. And doe we not vse to say that to our selues, the state of manly life is first required, that so then we may be able to doe the worcks of men.</hi> Thus S.

                  <p n="11">11. The manlinesse of spirituall grouth, is a middle state, betwixt the perfection <hi>of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptisme, and of grace consummate,</hi> to wit, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection gotten by growing and increasing in grace. This perfectiō, though it be gotten also by meritorious actes, and other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentes, is particularly attributed vnto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation for three respects First in respect that Confirmation is the next Sacrament in order vnto Baptisme, and so the first Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be receaued for the perfecting of Baptismall grace, and attayning vnto the fulnes of spirituall strength. Secondly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect that this Sacrament is instituted to gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17225:24"/> solidity, firmitude and strength in grace, which is the property of a ful manly state, which commonly is more stayed, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant then lower age. Thirdy because by Confirmation a man is marked, and chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctered vnto the greatest ād most māly act of fortitude, to wit, open confession of Christ, exposing his life to most cruell death for his honour. True it is, that by Baptisme we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue a character, by which we are made and marked as souldiers of Christ to fight in generall against all sinne; in particular against enemies inward, and inuisible, as are Diuells and the concupiscences of the flesh. But to fight against the visible enemies of faith, by patient suffering and constant con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession vnto death, men are properly and peculiarly marked by Confirmation; and to that end receaue speciall strength.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Hence I inferre, the comparison of Baptisme to corporall generation; and of Confirmation to Augmentation, hath simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude with dissimilitude. The similitude is, that as by generation we receaue the first being of life, which is made greater and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re perfect by augmentation. Soe by Baptis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me we receaue the first being of Gods rhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren by grace, which is made more perfect and strong by confirmation. The dissimili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is, that the being of Corporall life in birth is miserable, impotent, imperfect, and by augmentation, receaueth perfection and
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17225:25"/> sufficient strength to doe the deeds of men, which before was wanting. But in our spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall birth, we receaue spirituall life, with great aboundance of spirituall perfection, and strength, so that by confirmation, wee doe not passe from the state of weaknesse, and impotencie, to the state of sufficient ability, and strength, but from the state of perfect infused grace, and full sufficient strength, to a more perfect state of the same grace growne to greater perfection, by the receauing of Sacraments ordayned to that end.</p>

For though such as haue onely Baptismall Grace, be not spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually growne, yet they be greate in grace, and strong, as hauing perfection and aboundance of spirituall strength infused them in their birth, and so they be manly, able, strong to exercise christian vertue, though they haue not exercised that power as yet, and so haue not added to their manly birth, manly strength of spirituall grouth, which the confirmed haue.</p>

Secondly when the grace of confirmation is sayd to be farre greater then that of Baptisme, this is spoken of the grace of confirmation as including the grace of Baptisme, otherwise if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the grace of confirmation by it selfe, with the grace of Baptisme by it selfe, it is not certayne, that the grace of confirmation is greater, yea the grace of Baptisme is farre greater then that of confirmation, sayth the subrilest of the Diuines.<note place="margin">Scotus in <hi>4.</hi> d. <hi>7.</hi>

Hence two thinges be clearely dedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced: first that the Baptized in the Primitiue Church, could not be accounted christians fully, vntill they were confirmed by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shopp. The reason is, for that none can be tearmed christians fully, that be not fully chrismed, that is, annoynted with chrisme inwardly, and outwardly in soule, and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. None were then chrismed outwardly, but in Confirmation by the Bishop, so then none could be tearmed fully christians, that were not confirmed by the Bishop. Secon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dly I inferre, that the English Catholickes that are baptized after the Catholicke rite, or that haue receaued the Catholicke cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of Baptisme, though not confirmed by the Bishop, were, and are fully christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans euery way.

                  <p n="23">23. This supposed, it is cleare that men chrismed in Baptisme by the Priest, are full and perfect christians, though they want Confirmation. For they that haue receaued the Sacrament of christendome full and compleate, be full and perfect christians: But such as are chrismed in baptisme by the Priest, haue the Sacrament of christendome full, and compleat, not only inwardly, but also outwardly, and according to the signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catiō imported by the worde christian, that is, one chrismed or anoynted.

                  <p n="24">24. I add that this Chrisming in Baptisme by the Priest, was instituded by the church, to supply not onely the signification of Episcopall Chrisme, but also the effect, to wit, to conserue and confirme men in Baptismall grace.

                  <p>His second reason is, the vtilitie and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity of Confirmation, which cannot be giuen in the Bishops absence This hath been answered allreadie for there is noe shew of probabilitie, that a Countrie is bound to gett Confirmation, when the same cannot be had without a persecution.

                  <p>This reason sheweth that the diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, to put Bishops in euery particular church or Country cannot be absolute, but at the most condicionall, for places which at one time require a Bishop or many Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops, may with time so change, that Bishops seeme in respecte of them neyther conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient nor needfull nor vsefull. For example, if a Country that was once a Florishing Christianitie be brought to that state, that now the Catholicks are so fewe as they may

What is the end that God commandeth that in euery particular Church there be a Bishop? noe doubt to the end that all Christians might be furnished with Priestes, and such necessary Sacramēts as depend on Priests, for the Ordination of Priests, and Church Ministers, is the only thing that doth infer the necessity of a Bishop, as shall be proued in the next pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragraph; hence where a church that once needeth Bishops to ordayne Priests, now needeth them not, but is in such state that a Bishop would rather breede inconuenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce then any furtherance, then noe doubt the Pope is not bound to giue that country Bishops.

<pb n="108" facs="tcp:17225:62"/> diuine law requires no more then that there be some Bishops in the Church, so many in number, as there be no danger that the whole order be suddaynly taken away by theyr deathes, and so dispersed ouer the world, that all christians are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided sufficiently of learned and vertuous Priests. If this be done, the diuine law is sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfyed, though there be no Bishops in France, or Spaine or England: But if the sense be, that according to the present dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of times, and circumstances of place, the diuine law, of hauing Bishops, cannot be kept except, there be Bishops in France, Spaine and England, it is partly false, true in respecte of France and Spa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Doctours assumption: there is no more reason that Spayn should be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerned by particular Bishops, rather then England, speaking of what is requisite now, according to the present disposition of things, is palpably false, Though speaking in generall, abstracting from times, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine law of hauing Bishops, doth noe mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re concerne Spaine then England.</p>

THe diuine law is farr from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing the Popes Holynes to giue England a particular Bishop, as hath beene shewed: Rather our church (as things now stande) may seeme vncapable of a Bishop, except with some dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation in the Holy canons, which for the perfect obseruation of the diuine insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution haue beene exacted. To proue this, we must suppose that the diuine institution and holy canons require, that a Bishop be not placed in townes and villages, or ouer a pettie multitude of Christians, nor where he is not needed in respect of orday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Priests. The reason is, the honour and dignitie of a Bishop, that Office grow not contemptible, if one be placed where he is not <hi>generator Patrum,</hi> the Father of fathers, that is, of Priests, and where he can giue the people nothing necessary which they may not haue from Priests. For if this were, the feete might say to such a head, <hi>wee neede you not</hi> without you wee had, and when you are gone, wee shall haue all things necessary vnto saluation.</p>

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:17225:63"/> of Priest, but also for gouernment, Bishops are necessary, to wit, to administer iustice, to conserue in the Church vnity and peace. I answere, when a Church may haue iuridicall administration of iustice, the power of gouernement is needfull, in which case they of such a Church neede a gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; but if they neede not also ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of priests from their gouernour, there is no neede their gouernour bee a Bishop. The power of gouernement of that Church, may be fitly committed and sufficiently exercised by a Preist. But if a Bishop be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary in a Diocesse to consecrate Preists, so that the priests of the diocesse bee his sonnes, the deuine law (if not of necessity yet in reason and decency) requireth that the scepter of gouernemēt bee in his hands, not in the hands of any of his sonnes. The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore, giue me a multitude of Christians neuer so greate that hath no neede of a Bishop to ordaine priests, and I will bouldly say, that there is noe neede that the gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nnour of that Company bee a Bishop, yea, put case, Ordinatiō of Priestes and Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were not necessary in the Church, it will presently follow that there is noe nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de that the vniuersall Church be gouerned by Bishops superiour to Priestes.

Doctour will neuer bee able to prooue) that there is a Diuine precept to take Confirmation, yet this will not inforce a Bishop, except also hee be needfull to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine preistes. The Reason is. Because if there bee such a precept to receiue Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation yet it bindeth not, <hi>cum non potest com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modè haheri</hi> as all teach, when Confirmation cannot bee had, but incommodiously, nor without the Churches doinge a thing vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>usuall, vndecent, forbidden by the canons, as is the Ordaining of a Bishop for a place, where hee cannot haue imployment worthy
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:17225:65"/> of his state, nor bee father of fathers. This I farther Confirme, by what Deuines com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly teach concerning the Holy Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, And I argue thus. The Church is not bound to prouide Christians of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Confirmation, more then of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Eucharist at the houre of death. Yea this obligation is the greater, because without doubt the Deuine law bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth to receiue and giue the Eucharist against death; but that there is a diuine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepte to receiue Confirmation, is very vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certaine, the more common tenent of Deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes being for the contrary. And yet the Church is not bound to giue the Sacrament of the Eucharist,<note place="margin">Suares in <hi>3.</hi> p. d. <hi>8.</hi> &amp; alij commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niter.</note> when the same can not bee giuen without doing against the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued Customes, Ceremonies, and Canons. As when a Preist to giue a Consecrated hoast celebrate not beeing fasting, or in leuened bread, or without the sacred roabes of priesthood, as al deuines commonly teach. Therefore much lesse is the Church bound to prouide Christians of Confirmation, by doing against her receiued custome and Canon, of not makinge a Bishop ouer Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that neede not Ordination of priests, and consequently needeth not a Gouernour Bishop.</p>
                  <p n="29">29. Hence wee may admire gods singu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar wisedome in directing his Vicar, in the gouernement of his Church to obserue the
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:17225:65"/> sacred Canons, and by no importunity of men to bee mooued to violate receiued auncient customes. Wee may learne also euer to obey his Holynesses ordinances, which although wee see not the reason or conueniency of them, yet are still iustified within themselues.

                  <p>And first, that Regulars are of the Hie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rarchie absolutely, and not only in this or that sense, I holde it a point of faith. For whosoeuer are members of the Church, are of the Hierarchie or Hierarchicall bodie of Christ, consisting of members of different orders and offices. Let vs heare M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour c. 2. n. 5. <hi>The Hierarchie or distinction of orders and degrees, is proued, because S.

<pb n="138" facs="tcp:17225:76"/> rest, which haue diuerse functions</hi> Thus he; whereby it is cleare, that to say, that Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are not of the Hierarchie, is as much as to say, they are not of the Church, nor members hauing anie function in Christs' mysticall bodie; so that if anie stagger about making Regulars of the Hierarchie, they may in the same manner moue doubtes, whether they are of the Church.<note place="margin">Ibid. n. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> Would M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour be thought to doubt of this? Againe sayth M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour: <hi>The Church may be proued a Hierarchie, because it is compared to an armie, in which is a Generall, Captaines, Lieutenants, Sergeants, Corporals, and common Soldiers. To a familie, in which is the Paterfami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lias, the good-man of the house, his wife, his children, his seruants; To a shipp, which sayleth in the sea of the world, tossed with waues of temptation, whose shipwright is God, whose Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernour is Christ, and vnder him, his Vicar; he that ruleth the decke or foreparte of the shipp is the Bishop, whose shipp-man and mariner is the Priest, whose dispensers are Deacons, whose sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers the rest of Christians: To a kingdome, which is a multitude ordered and disposed by diuers dignities and degrees whereof some gouerne▪ so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me are gouerned.</hi> Thus M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.

<pb n="139" facs="tcp:17225:76"/> Christ, if not Captaines, at the least, cōmon soldiers; in his familie, if not children, at the least seruants; in his ship, if not marriners, at the least soldiers; in his kingdome, if not Gouernours, at the least in the degree of the gouerned.</p>

For Religious leauing of all is an act of the loue of God, being done to the end to cleaue and adheare vnto Christ, an act of charity, and liberality to the poore, by bestowing all on them, an act of religion because done by vow, giuing away to God our power and faculty of hauing any thing besydes only him. Seing actuall leauing of all (done as it ought) is an act of many excellent vertues, how can it want the perfection of high merite. And if it haue the perfection of merit, how can M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour with truth say so absolutly, it is no perfection. But speaking of the perfection of state, actuall leauing of all is an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of perfection, not essentially perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; for the perfection of state is an habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall constant disposition of mind, <hi>quae</hi> sayth S.

Or it is a readinesse of hart, still virtually continuing to reiect what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer may diminish, alay, and to imbrace whatsoeuer may further and aduaunce the feruent exercise of diuine loue. Now actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all leauing of all things for Christ, is not an habituall disposition, of mind, but an actuall exercise of pure loue towards God. Therfore it is not essentially perfection but an instrument therof. Actes be instruments to produce the habit, yea by one act per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and intense, the habit is oftentimes ingendred. Actuall leauing of all thinges to cleaue vnto Christ, is an act of diuine charity, most perfect, pure, and excellent. It is therfore a most excellent instrument to settle the mind in perfection, that is in a constant disposition to fly whatsoeuer may hinder the soule from being carryed total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards God.</p>
                  <p n="14">14. Some learned Diuines hould, that perfection of state doeth consist in one per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect act of Diuine loue, not as actually exercised, but as virtually, and morally still remaining as being neuer retracted or recalled. Accordinge to which doctrine, one may defend that the essentiall, perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of a Religious state, doth consist in a mans leauing of all thinges, and conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cratinge of himselfe with perfect charity
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:17225:90"/> vnto God, as this act doth still morally remaine, in being neuer recalled, eyther outwardly befoore men by goinge back, or inwardly in the sight of God, by repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, or voluntary neglect of his vowed duty. But rather dayly renewed, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued, and increased, by the exercise of new actes of Religion and Diuine loue. And thus wee may say, that actuall leauing of all thinges by vow, out of desire of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect vnion with God as actually exercised, is an instrument of perfection, as morally and habitually remayninge in the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of vowes exactly obserued, is formal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and essentially perfection.</p>

Doth an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strument cease to be an instrument because it worketh the effecte? Doth the way to London cease to be the way, because it reacheth as farr as London, and is ioyned therewith, way rather the instrument can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be effectuall, except, it be ioyned with

                  <p n="16">16. Wherfore his speculation about pouerty, <hi>that Pouerty in preparation of minde is either Diuine,</hi>

True; But▪ amongst them also there were tousands tat were <hi>praepared</hi> in minde to be poore, and leaue all rather then loose their honour, or some humane com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moditye, to which they were addicted.

Doctours onely one, betwixt Religious and other Christians prepared in mind? First their Mentall leauing of all <hi>is passiue,</hi> to suffer all thinges to be taken from them, when they can not hould them any longer without sinne. Religious mens leauing of al is <hi>actiue,</hi> giuinge away all they haue to the poore of free loue of Christ, when they might haue kept their states without lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uinge him. Secondly those though they leaue all, yet still retayne a right to recouer them, yea allso a preparation of minde to recouer them, or other wealth, if conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently they may: But the Religious man giues away, all that he hath, retayning no right to any things, nor any will, so that

Fourthly other Christians are bound to lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue all thinges, when the retayning and vse of them, is contrarie to the Diuine lawe: the Religious man hath, by vow left all that may any wayes hynder the perfection of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Loue, and stay his will from runninge totallye into the Diuine imbracements, which is not ordinary, but singular perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, as sayeth S.

Finally the preparation of minde to leaue all, which euery Christian is bounde to haue, is onely in a generall, and confuse manner, so farforth as he doth in generall purpose neuer to offende God. He is not (beinge out of occasions) bound to descen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de to particulars, preparinge his minde to leaue all expressely in case it were necessary. Hence their preparation of mind is excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge weake, and such as were they put to it, they would neuer endure the onsett, but runne away, leauinge rather Christ, then their wealth. And yet this preparation so in generall and in darke, miserable, and infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, doth (when occasions doe not vrge) suffice vnto saluation. But the Religious man with his preparation of harte, must and doeth descende to particulars, with an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly altitude of minde, and loue of aeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, treadinge vnder foote, whatsoeuer is emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and desireable in this world. Whence pouerty in preparation of minde, which euen Bishops ordinarily must haue, is no wayes comparable to the heyght and strength of Religious pouerty; much lesse had M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour reason to compare with it, yea preferre before it, that preparation of minde euery Christian by state is bounde to haue, wherein he may seeme to approach too neere vnto the condemned opinion of <hi>Gulielmus de sancto amore</hi> related by Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stro (lib. 12. contra haereses, verbo <hi>Paupertas:</hi>

                     <p n="24">24. Secondly, as the Bishop cannot wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thout the Popes licence leaue his Bishopri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cke to become Religious; so no Religious man without licence of his Religion may consent vnto his election to the state of Bishop, and this is so forbidden, that if he giue consent, the same is of no force, as is determined in the Canon law <hi>cap. si Religio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus</hi> &amp; cap. <hi>quorundam de electionibus in</hi> 6. <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sensus sic praestitus non teneat, let his consent so giuen be of no force.</hi> yea moreouer in punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this his presumptuous giuing as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, the election afore-hand made becomes inualid, <hi>in poenam praesumptionis illius electio eadem ipso facto viribus vacuetur.</hi> And this proueth the state of Bishops not to be so absolutely more perfect then Religious, as M Doctour doth conceiue.

                     <p n="30">30. THe excellencye of a Religious state, which is wantinge in the state of Bishops is this, that Religion is a state of perfection to be gotten, wheras the state of Bishops is a state of perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction alreadie gotten. To bee in the state of perfection alreadie gotten, doth not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to bee in a state by profession wherof perfection is actually gotten, but to bee in a state which supposeth a man to be afore-hand perfect, giuinge him no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes proper to his state to be made perfect, if perhaps he be not so when he vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes the state, so that a man imperfect beinge made Bishop, if afterwardes hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pely he come to be perfect, this is done by the exercise of actions vnto which he is not bound by his state. As one that is in the middest of his enemyes, is in the state of a man alreadie well armed, that is, in a state which requires that a man be armed afore-hand, because beinge in those
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:17225:101"/> most straights it is too late to seeke for armour. Thus Bishops are sayd to be in a state of perfection alreadie gotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause in a state which requireth a man aforehand perfect, and complete in charity and habituall disposition of pure deuine loue. If he be not so alreadie he is in a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous state, because in a state requiringe much perfection without the proper mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes to get it. But the state of Religion is a state to get perfection, or of perfection to be gotten, because it bindeth men to vse all excellent meanes to get perfection by renouncinge all impediments of perfection, and by tyinge themselues by vow vnto the fountayne of all perfection. Hence a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious man when he first vndertakes his state, is not bound to be alreadie perfect, but by the very profession of a Religious state, and by his continuinge therin, he is made excellently perfect.</p>
                     <p n="31">31. The comparison betweene a Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man and a Bishop in respect of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, seemeth to me not vnlike to the comparison betwixt the state of a Gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leman and of a Marchaunt, in reguard of wealthinesse. The Gentleman is the state of wealthinesse alreadie gotten, because his state bindeth him in honour to actions wherin riches are consumed and wasted, but hath no meanes as Gentleman, to get or encrease the sufficiency of his tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:17225:102"/> substance, whence it happely he be not really wealthie, he is in a poore state, because eyther he must omitt actions vnto which he is bound in honour, or else runne into debt, or finally vse some waye of gettinge riches inferiour to his cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linge. But the marchant is in the state to gett riches or of riches to be gotten, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause by state he is bound to actions wherby wealth is assuredly gotten, and is not bound to those actions the Gentleman is, by which riches are consumed. The Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shop seemes like to the Gentleman, and Religious vnto the Marchant, only there is this difference that the state of Marchant is ignoble, because it is tendinge to the gaynige and gettinge of earthly pelfe, which be thinges vile and abiect, but Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious profession, is not only rich, and wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lethy, but also noble and honorable, assen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinge to the purchasinge, of the wealth of vertues, which be of all thinges the most glorious, and illustrious accordinge to that of S.

                     <p n="34">34. HEnce finally I conclude, that though speculatiuely the state of a Bp. be be more perfect, as considered according to the meere nature therof; yet because in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctise a thing is to be taken according to all the circumstances that waite vpon it, and according as morally the same may be had, therfore absolutly the state of Religion is to be more esteemed, and accompted the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pier, and for euery one in particular the more perfect. For in a state to know the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy therof, we must consider not onely the perfection of the actions vnto which it bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth and the strict obligation it layeth vpon the professours, but also the possibility or probability to performe such high obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; for to be bound vnder payne of sinne and damnation to performe actions, that morally speaking are not performable, is not
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:17225:103"/> so much a perfect as a pittifull state. M. Iohn de Auila a secular Priest of great estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me for his learning and sanctity of life, did vse to say, that so great and so many were the obligations of a Bishop, that if on should performe but one third part of them, he should be accompted a great saint, and yet this a loue would not suffise to saue him from Hell.<note place="margin">Vide Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lium a lapide in Apocalip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sim pag <hi>60.</hi> c. <hi>3.</hi> v. <hi>20.</hi>
                        </note> Pius quintus of the order of S.

Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus 3. (as Iouius writes) in the article of his death sayd. How I wish I had been vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cooke in some conuent of Capucins, rather then to haue susteyned this dignity next vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God these 16. yeares. The like feeling had Cardinall Alexandrino, Nephew to the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>resayd Pius, in the passage of death. Oh (sayd he) how do I now wish I had spent all my dayes in my owne order, that I had neuer been made Bishop and Cardinall, but had liued vnder-cooke in some conuent. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phōsus Ramirius Vergara a famous Doctor of spayne, being towards death, sayd with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:17225:104"/> great comfort, that he tooke two fauours of God donne him as pledges of his euerlasting saluation. The one that he neuer permitted him to be made Bishop; the second that he had giuen him for his spirituall guide F. Villanoua of the Society, whom he did vse to call his good Angell. By these examples we may gather that at the howre of death when by the light of approaching eternity the true colours of thinges are discouered, many will frame an higher iudgment of the excellency of Religion, and apprehend mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re deepely of the daungers and difficulties of saluation attending on the state of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops, then now they doe.</p>

The worthy &amp; renowned worke termed the Rhemes Testament, to the setting forth of which the learnedest of our English Cleargy, Doctour Allen being cheife, did concurre, hath these words: <hi>The Apostles vowed pouerty, and professed the Religious state of perfection;</hi> in the table of controuersies in the word vow, which also they deliuer in their annotation vpon the 21. verse of the 19. Chapter of S. Matthew.</p>

To our purpose hee hath these words. <hi>Wee haue fully prooued that S.

Therefore by the Apostles examples, the professours of monasticall life defend themselues. What doe I say of the Apostles? they haue Christ himselfe for their Cheis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teine,

In this se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Question Catholique Doctours be diuided, some say they vowed pouerty, so as they were incapable to bee owners of any thing in particular, though they had something in Common: this is taught by Nauarr, and S. Thomas, others hould that they were owners of somethings, of which yet by reason of their vow they had onely a restrained and subordinate vse; thus Suarez teacheth, and Sarmiento seemeth to haue held no more. Vasques saith the thing is vncertaine, yet the sentence of S. Thomas,
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:17225:112"/> is more probable, to wit, that the Apostles vowed so perfecte pouerty, as that they could not be owners of any thing in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.

Soe now, since the Church hath forbidden the inuen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of new Religious without the Popes approbation, this faculty is ceased. But this question requireth more exacte discussion. Howsoeuer, it is certaine that Christ Iesus had power and faculty supreme to gather to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether a family or Colledge of Disciples to liue in Religious discipline vnder him, and to accept of their vowes: And so, to doubt whether the Apostles vowes were sufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly admitted, or approoued, there is no cause.</p>

                  <hi>but to Bishops and Priestes;</hi> this proposition may haue different senses. First that the deuine law, and institution re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiers that the gouernment of the Church be giuen to Bishops, and Priestes, though Seculars rather then vnto Regulars that bee not Priests. This may seeme M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours sence, for hee saves <hi>not giuen to Regulars, but to Bishops, and Priestes,</hi> which shewes hee
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:17225:118"/> meaneth Regulars that bee neither Bp. nor Priests. In this sence his saying is true, but little to our purpose. The second sence may bee that the deuine law and institutiō about the gouernmēt of the Church by Bishops, and Priestes was not first exercised, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by the Institutour himselfe in Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Bishops, and Priests. This sence is false seeing the first Bishops and Priests were the Apostles, who were Regulars, as hath been proued. The third sence that though Christ did giue the gouerment of the Church, at the first to Regulars, yet not with a law, or institution that the Bishops and Priests gouerning the Church should afterwards still bee Regulars. This sence is also true, because Christ gaue not any command that Priests should vow pouerty, or chastity, as the Apostles did, so that without breach of the deuine law they may haue possessions, or wyues.</p>

<pb n="224" facs="tcp:17225:119"/> this the state of Religious may seeme to haue much honour aboue the state of Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops and Priests, because their state nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther essentially, nor by the deuine positiue law requiers speciall chastity aboue that of vulgar Christians, where as the state of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious not only by deuine positiue law, but euen essentially includs the profession of Angelicall purity. In the second sence Bishops and Priests bee Regulars by deuine institutiō, that is, Christ by way of counsell, and exhortation requiers that Bishops, and Priests should liue in chastity, and abandon the allurements of temporall wealth, for these counseills giuen vnto all, are pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly conuenient for the cleargy, which is the cause that in the Apostles tyme, and afterwards some ages, Priests were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly Regulars, as might bee proued, and is proued by M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.

Doctour sayth these words were spoken to priests, and Bishops, and they by vertue of this speach receaue power to teach, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert nations, because they bee the succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sours of the Apostles, and disciples to whom this speach was directed. Therefore a Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hop and a priest by these words haue by diuine ordinance authority, and right to gouerne all christian nations, and Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, whereof one part is to prouide them pastours. Hence the foresayde M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Anto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius doth consequently grant that euery
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:17225:123"/> Bishop can erect new christianities, and Bishopricks, and giue them Bishops by the right and authority they haue by the deui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ordinance.</p>
               <p n="9">9. I know not whether M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour will proceede so farre, yet hee hath certaine words that may seeme somewhat to insi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate such a conceipt. For c. 9. n. 4. or pag. 245. li. 6. hee sayth, <hi>by the diuine institution Bishops and priests are to gouerne the Hierar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chie of the church, to preach, to minister Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and therefore at first Bishops, and prists only preached the Gospell, conuerted countries, and amongst the conuerted placed Bishops, and Priests to gouerne them, and administer Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> By these words it may bee conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, that a Bishop, or a priest hath authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and right by the deuine ordinance to preach, and baptise infidells, and afterward to gouerne them by supreame power, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing them Bishops, and pastours. For now a Dayes a Bishop and a priest hath by suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cession that power, and authority of deuine ordinance, which the Bishops and priests had at the first, as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour affirmeth: But as hee sayth, Bishops and priests at first did by Christs institution and by their authority of deuine ordināce preach to Infidells, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert them, gouerne them being conuerted, and amongst them place Bishops and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stours. Therefore now a Dayes a secular Bishop or priest by his ordinary authority
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:17225:124"/> of diuine right may goe to preach to Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dells, conuert them, gouerne them being cōuerted, and amongst them place Bishops, and pastours. If this bee true, then our se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular priests in England may amongst Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholiques conuerted exercise this their power of deuine ordinance in gouerning them, and in placing Bishops, and pastours as they shall thinke fit. If any say that secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar priests may gouerne, and place Bishops amongst Catholiques conuerted by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues. But the Catholiques of England ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue not been conuerted, and made by them only, but a greate part by the plantation of regulars. I answere this will not hinder M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours conceipt, because hee will haue regulars in England to bee but helpes of secular priests, and their instruments, and consequently the conuersion of Catholi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ques done by regulars is to bee attributed vnto the body of secular priests, as vnto the principall agents.

               <p n="10">10. About the proofes hee hath brought I note two things, by which their weaknes and the falshood of his doctrine is discoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: the first is in alledging scriptures, hee doth cunningly helpe his cause by adding somthing which is not in the text. Christ (sayth hee, pag. 243. c. 9. n. 12.) <hi>to the Apostles, Disciples, and their successours said. Goeing therefore teach yee all nations,</hi> and agai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne the same hee inculcateth by S.

                  </gap>. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour saith Christ spake these words, to the Apostles, ād Disciples, whereas the Ghospel hath no more, but that they were spoken to the Apostles.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Math.</hi> 28.</note> In the first place of S. Mathew the text is this. <hi>And the eleuen Disciples went into Galilee vnto the montaine which Iesus had
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:17225:125"/> appoynted, and seeing him, they adored him, but some doubted, and hee sayd to them all.

Doctour add <hi>Disciples?</hi> The reason is because hee sayth that Bis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hops succeeded the Apostles, the secular Priests succeeded 72. Disciples.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>c.</hi> 5. <hi>n.</hi> 8. <hi>pag.</hi> 124.</note> Hence if the words giuing power to preach to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and gouerne the church had been spoken to the Apostles only, that deuine ordinance would haue come by succession to Bishops only, and not to secular Priests. wherefore that secular priests might bee partakers with Bishops in the power of diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ordinance to conuert nations, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerne them being conuerted, hee addeth to the text <hi>Disciples,</hi> ioyning them in this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission with the Apostles; which certainly is not true; for howsoeuer some other Disciples besides the Apostles not only men, but also woemen might bee present, (which yet is more then is in those places expresly affirmed) yet without question
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:17225:125"/> the words, <hi>goeing therefore teach yee all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> were spoken only to the Apostles. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can any by vertue of this ordinance doe it but they, and such as haue commission from them.</p>
               <p n="11">11. The second thing I note, is, that M<seg rend="sup">•</seg>. Doctour doth contradict himselfe, in saying that this deuine ordinance of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to preach to all nations and gouerne them being cōuerted giuen to the Apostles, is deriued vnto their successours, to witt, vnto Bishops; for elswere c. 5. n. 7. hee wry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth, <hi>The authority of the Apostles in respect of extent, and largnes was extraordinary, which should haue been limited to particular places, as the iurisdiction of Bishops is.</hi> And againe in the same place. <hi>Because the vniuersall authority as the Apostles was extraordinary, and delegate, therefore Bishops who are their successours doe not succeed them in that ample iurisdiction.</hi> Thus hee, which is contrary to what heere hee sayth, that Christ sayd to his Apostles, and their successours who are Bishops, <hi>goeing the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>refore teach yee all nations.</hi> For if Christ spake these words, not only to the Apostles but to their successours, then Bishops succeede the Apostles in the authority giuen by these words, which is authority ouer all nations to conuert them, and gouerne them being conuerted. If the iurisdiction of Bishops bee limited by deuine ordinance to particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar places, how can they haue authority of

Doctour as I haue noted, doth much insinuat that Secular Priests in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes by them cōuerted may place Bishops, as hauing authority so to doe immediatly of God.<note place="margin">dedicatory. n. <hi>12,</hi>

Finally his saying that Bishops and Priests at first preached the Ghospel, conuerted countryes,<note place="margin">

<pb n="244" facs="tcp:17225:130"/> amongst the conuerted, placed Bishops to gouerne them, doth more then insinuate that he thinkes Secular Priests in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryes by them conuerted may place Bishops to gouerne. To this doctrine his practise is sutable, in that he vrgeth Catholiques to admitte my Lord of Chalcedon as their Bishop and head Pastour. For either they are to receaue him cominge to be Bishop of himselfe, which were a thing no wayes iusticeable, or els as being sent and ordained by Secular Priests, who are by the deuine institution gouernours of the Church, for he doth neuer so much as once affirme his holines appointed him to be head Pastour, and not delegate.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. If this be M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours opinion, although I will not preuent the holy sea by my censure therof, yet to preuent the deception of others, I wil affirme that it is most certaine Catholique doctrine, that no person vpon earth, besides the Pope, hath by deuine Ordinance the office to plant new Christianityes, erect new Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoprickes,<note place="margin">l. <hi>4.</hi> de Eccles c. <hi>8.</hi>
                     </note> and place Bishops in them. This is taught expresly by Bellarmine, and proued by these formal wordes. <hi>The ere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting of new Bishoprikes and Bishops cannot per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to any, whose power is contained within compasse▪ such as the power of particular Bishops is; but only to him, who is gouernour of the whole Church, and to whom properly the charge
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:17225:130"/> of propagating the Church doth belong, such as all the Apostles were. Peeter indeed by office, the rest by delegation, and whosoeuer doth other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise enter, he is not of the Apostolical Church, seing he cannot deduce his origen from the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles. Notwithstanding we doe not deny also Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarches and Metropolitans may somtymes erect new Bishoprickes, as S. Athanasius did in the East, and S.

                  <p>IT is not so easy for those of the vulgar sort to conceaue the difference of the power of consecration, from the power of Iurisdiction in a Bishop, whom they find to be Bishop by order, they presently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaue he is Bishop by office. Of this their weaknes M<seg rend="sup">r</seg> Doctour is content to make his aduantage, and because my Lord of Chalcedon is Bishop by order and name, because also he is <hi>theirs,</hi> as being their countryman, being applyed to helpe them, and hauing the faculty to giue them Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation, hence tacitly arguing <hi>à diuisis ad coniuncta,</hi> he supposeth as cleere that he is <hi>their Bishop,</hi> which supposed, he doth fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conclude, that whatsoeuer of reue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence and obedience is due from a Church
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:17225:132"/> to their Bishop, the Catholiques of England owe the same to his Lordship, to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose accommodating the sayings of fathers, requiring ful subiection of Christians to their Priests and Bishop, and their repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hensions of people disobedient. His dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catory is ful of this, but most of al his se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenth Chapter, the drift and cōclusion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof, is contained in these the last wordes therof. <hi>Let vs then obey our Bishop as our lawful Superiour, reuerence him as Lord and spirituall Prince, loue him as our father.</hi> But how doth M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>.

Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause I thinke the learned Reader wil not beleeue M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour would vtter a para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxe so strange, I wil set downe his wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, wherin he doth not only so affirme, but vndertakes solemnly the proofe therof. Thus he beginneth that Chapter.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>pag.</hi> 188.</note>
                     <hi>Out of that which hath bene said in the precedent Chapters, it followeth euidently, that the Bishop in power and dignity of Order, taketh the highest Roome and dignity in the Church of God. For though the Archbishop and Primate be aboue him in power of iurisdiction and Ecclesiastical dignity, yet in the order and power of Bishop, he is as high as any of them euen as the Pope himselfe,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:17225:133"/> True it is the Pope is head of the Church, and</hi> Pastor Pastorum, <hi>the Pastour of Bishops them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues, yet this superiority is in Iurisdiction, by which he can prescribe lawes to the whole Church, but in power of Order the Bishop can validly doe as much as the Pope himselfe,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Therfore in degree of Order the poorest Bishop is as great as the richest and greatest Patriarcke, yea as the Pope himselfe, and Superiour to Priests, much more to the laity be the Princes of Monarckes. When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce I may deduce two conclusions, the one, that the Bishop is to be honoured of all, euen of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narckes and Emperours, the second, that he is also to be humbly obeyd of al his subiects.</hi> Thus M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour. These wordes shew that M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. Doctour holdes obedience to be due to a Bishop in regard of his Superiority ouer others in the degree of order, which do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine were it true, it would in deed thence follow, that my Lord of Chalcedon is to be humbly obeyed of al in England. But how much M<seg rend="sup">•</seg>. Doctour is herein deceaued may be cleerly demonstrated. First because if a Bishop were to be obeyed in regard of his superiority of Order, he were no lesse to be obeyed then the Pope, for they that be equal in the superiority to which obedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce is due, are equally to be obeyed. The poo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest Bishop in the world is equall to the Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe in Superiority of order, vnto which obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience is due as M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour saith, therfore the poorest Bishop is no lesse humbly to be
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:17225:133"/> obeyed then the Pope. Secondly if a Bishops Superiority in order did require obedience of his inferiours, then subiection or infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority to the Bishop in order did owe him obedience, and consequently whosoeuer be inferiour to the Bishop in order, owe him obedience, and be bound to obey him. But all men vnder heauen that be not Bishops are vnder Bishops in respect of dignity and power of order, yea saith M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour c. 7. n. 7. <hi>none in heauen be he Angel or Archangel, nay a Cherubin or a Seraphin, is aboue a Bishop.</hi> Therfore all creatures in heauen and earth (only Bishops excepted) are bound hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to obey the poorest Bishop, or my Lord of Chalcedon. If this be absurd then M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour must retract his proposition, that because the Bishop is equal to the Pope in order, thence it is deduced that he is to be obeyed of all his subiects.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. Wherfore most certaine it is, that Obedience is due to the Bishop in respect of his power of Iurisdiction, not in res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of his power of order. Hence if he haue no power of Iurisdiction, he is not to be humbly obeyed, but rather he is humbly to obey such as haue iurisdiction and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund ouer him, though they be not Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shops. A Bishop that leauing his Bishop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricke retyreth to religion stil retaineth his power of order, and is therin equal to the Pope and superiour to al Priests, and yet he
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:17225:134"/> is not to be obeyed, but to obey his Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, who for order is vnder him, and but a Priest. Do we not see titular Bishops, such as my Lord of Chalcedon is, and suffra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans who for order are equal to the Pope, to be vnder Bishops, and at their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and obedience, that be not so much as Priests? false then is M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours asser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that from the Bishops Superiority in order aboue Priests, and his equality therin vnto the Pope, is deduced that he must be obeyed of his subiects. True it is, that if he haue subiects committed to his charge, they be humbly to obey him, but this is not because he is for power of order equal to the Pope, but because he hath power of commaund and iurisdiction ouer them.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. Hence M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour doth not alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adge any sufficient cause why Catholiques should be subiect to my Lord of Chalcedō, when he saith,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>p.</hi> 206. <hi>lin.</hi> 13.</note> c. 7. n. 14. of him and his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decessour, <hi>though they had not that worldly splendour, honour, and riches, which our antient Bishops had, yet they are not inferiour to them in degree of order, no not in learning, life or labour, and therfore are to be honoured as much as they were and to be prouided for according as these times wil permitte, because as S. Paul saith, Priests that rule wel, that is Bishops, let them be esteemed worthy of double honour, not only of the honour of capp and knee, but of honourable maintenance also.</hi> This inference M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:17225:134"/> maketh, is greater then his premises wil afford, for though my Lord of Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon were inferiour to none of our antient Bishops in the degree of order, or in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, life and labour, yet this doth not proue him to be ruler of our Church or worthy of double honour, if he be not also our proper Bishop, for also some Bishops that be Religious are equal to my Lord of Chalcedon in the degree of order, and in learning, life, and labour, and yet cannot they claime maintenance of any Church, because they haue no iurisdiction ouer any Church. Had M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour said that my Lord of Chalcedon is not inferiour to our antient Bishops, either in the degree of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der or in power of iurisdiction, or in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, life, and labour, he had strooken ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but this is so false as he durst not affirme it. And yet except he affirme it, yea proue it, he wil neuer get his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship one penny of maintenance as due to him in iustice. For Delegats are to receaue their stipend and maintenance from the Prince by whom they are sent, and not from the people vnto whom they be sent. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctours comparison that his Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship is equal to our antient Bishops in lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ninge, life, and labour, to me seemeth ouer slender and ouer lashinge. For if his mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning be that my Lord is not inferiour in le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arning, life and labour to some of our an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:17225:135"/> Bishops, the commendation is but smal; In so mighty a number of Bishops some haue bene for learning life and labour of so litle esteeme, as they were scarce wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tly of the bread they did eate, much lesse of double honour or honourable mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But if the prayse be that my Lord is for learning, life and labour inferiour to none of our antient Bishops, the prayse may seeme greater then M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; for wil M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour say he meant to equal his Lordship in learning life and labour to S. Augustine our Apostle, or to S. Wilfride, or S. Cuthbert, or S. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stan, or S. Thomas our glorious martyr? Howsoeuer; obedience is not due to lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, nor to sanctity, nor to industry, no nor vnto the dignity of order, but only to iurisdiction, and to him that is Bishop by office, such an one though he neither haue the order of Bishop nor the learning nor the sanctity, is to be humbly obeyed of al his subiects how learned and holy, and for dignity of order eminent soeuer they be. Wil M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour euer make this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence good, a Bishop in degree of order is equal to the Pope, ergo, he is to be obeyed.</p>
                  <p n="12">12. His arguments shew rather the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, to witt, that the height of iurisdiction is that vnto which the subiection of humble obedience is due, which being found in a person, obedience must bow vnto him,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:17225:135"/> though he be no Bishop for order, nor emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent for learning or sanctity. Let vs heare one or two of his arguments: first saith he, <hi>The Apostle commaundeth</hi> that euery soule be subiect to higher powers,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>c.</hi> 7 <hi>n.</hi> 15. <hi>p.</hi> 208.</note> for there is no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer but of God, <hi>But the Bishop hath an higher power, for he hath power of order and iurisdiction, Ergo</hi> his flocke is subiect to it and must obey it. I answere S. Paul doth not say that euery one that hath any kind of higher power is to be obeyed, but that euery one is to obey higher powers, that is, them who be placed in office with power and authority to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maund and gouerne. The power of order to consecrate the body of Christ, to ordaine Priests, to hallow holy Chrisme and the like, be not powers, to which obedience is due, more then to the power of working mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, or the power of giuing much Almes, or the power and faculty to teach Theologie. M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour proueth the Bishop is to be obeyed of his subiects, because he hath iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>risdiction and is gouernour, which no man denyes or can doubt of, being in his right witts, and not because he is in degree of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der aboue all and equal to the Pope, which was his premise. And if he proue not this he cometh short of his intent, which is to haue my Lord of Chalcedon to be obeyed, because though he want the office of Bishop ouer England, yet in the degree of order he is equall euen to the Pope. This M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctour
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:17225:136"/> intended and promised to proue, and therfore al is impertinent that is brought to shew that Bishops that haue iurisdiction ouer a Diocesse and Church are to be obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of their subiects.</p>
                  <p n="13">13. Wherfore no lesse from the matter is his second argument,<note place="margin">

                     </note> I ans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>were, S. Paul doth commaund that subiects obey their Prelates whether they be Bishops or no.

Doctour promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed to deduce the obligation subiects haue to obey a Bishop, which he doth not perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, but only proueth that superiours are to be obeyed, wherof there is no question. In like manner in his third argument he shoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth wide of his marke bringing diuers sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the fathers that Bishops are to be obeyed. Who doubts therof? That which M<seg rend="sup">r</seg>. Doctour vndertooke to shew, is, that a Bishop must be obeyed in respect of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periority of his degree of order, because therin he is equal to the Pope.

For the first let the learning of no Doctour howsoeuer eminent for his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer writinges induce you to beleeue, that the sea Apostolique hath so long a tyme together transgressed the deuine law, in their ruling you without other Bishops immediatly as their proper flocke, that against charity they haue depriued you of the being a Christian Church, leauinge you to be stil weake and only litle ones in spiritual life, wanting that Sacrament without which you cānot be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Christiās, that is, haue courage to professe

Do not harken vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the pretence of deuine institution for go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernment of the Church, doe not venture to make to your selues, or to receaue from such pretended deuinely ordained gouernours, Bishops and Pastours.
